## About me
I'm a third year student at American University pursuing degrees in Statistics and Political Science with a minor in Data Science. I’m deeply interested and passionate about data science as it relates to politics I hope to integrate both into my career. I plan to graduate in Spring 2022.

I'm interested in **statistical modeling**, **data science**, **voter behavior**, and **legislative behavior**. I'm currently an Undergraduate Research Fellow at American University's [Center for Data Science](https://www.american.edu/spa/data-science/index.cfm) [Learn more about my experience.](./#experience)

In addition to coding, I love doing research and data science. [Check out my research.](./#research)

I'm originally from Seattle, Washington but I attended high school in Evanston, Illinois. When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with friends, drinking coffee, and learning history.

## Fun 
### Interests

* Soccer
* Football (Go Hawks!)
* History (especially Ancient Roman history!)
* Debate
* Travelling (when there isn't a global pandemic)

### Facts

* I can name every country on a blank map.
* I'm also very good with flags and can probably match most countries with their flag.
* Believe it or not, but I'm 100% Mexican. My name (except for my middle name) would never suggest it, but it's true!
* I participated in congressional debate in high school. It was pretty cool being called "Senator" whenever I competed. 
* Speaking of senators, I was actually elected Senator in the fourth grade (my elementary school was a MicroSociety school). Thought I should probably exclude that from my resume though... 
* My favorite movie is Interstellar by my favorite director Christopher Nolan. 
* I'm a coffee addict (which makes sense considering I'm from Seattle).
