## About me
I'm a third year student at American University pursuing degrees in Statistics and Political Science with a focus in Data Science. I’m deeply interested and passionate about data science as it relates to politics and I hope to integrate both into my career. I plan to graduate in Spring 2022.

I'm interested in **statistical modeling**, **machine learning**, **voter behavior**, **legislative behavior**, and **public opinion**. I'm currently a Polling & Research Intern at [Lake Research Partners](https://www.lakeresearch.com) and am also an Undergraduate Research Fellow at American University's [Center for Data Science](https://www.american.edu/spa/data-science/index.cfm). Learn more about [my experience.](./#experience)

I'm originally from Seattle, Washington but attended high school in Evanston, Illinois. When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with friends, drinking coffee, reading, and learning to play piano.
