## About me
I'm a fourth year student at American University pursuing degrees in Statistics and Political Science with a focus in Data Science. I’m deeply interested and passionate about data science, statistics, and their applications in business and consulting work. I graduate in Spring 2022.

I'm interested in **statistical modeling**, **machine learning**, **consumer behavior**, and **survey research**. I most recently enjoyed working as a Consumer Insights Intern at [Giant Food](https://www.giantfood.com) and thoroughly enjoyed serving as an Undergraduate Research Fellow at American University's [Center for Data Science](https://www.american.edu/spa/data-science/graduate-student-fellows.cfm). Learn more about [my experience.](./#experience)

I'm originally from Seattle, Washington but attended high school in Evanston, Illinois. When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with friends, drinking coffee, reading, and learning to play piano.
