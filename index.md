## About me
I'm a third year student at American University pursuing degrees in Statistics and Political Science with a focus in Data Science. I’m deeply interested and passionate about data science as it relates to politics and I hope to integrate both into my career. I plan to graduate in Spring 2022.

I'm interested in **statistical modeling**, **data science**, **voter behavior**, **legislative behavior**, and the study of **populism**. I'm currently an Undergraduate Research Fellow at American University's [Center for Data Science](https://www.american.edu/spa/data-science/index.cfm). I was most recently a Political & Research Fellow at political consulting firm, Blue Compass Strategies. [Learn more about my experience.](./#experience)

In addition to coding, I love doing research and expanding my data science skills.

I'm originally from Seattle, Washington but attended high school in Evanston, Illinois. When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with friends, drinking coffee, and learning history.
